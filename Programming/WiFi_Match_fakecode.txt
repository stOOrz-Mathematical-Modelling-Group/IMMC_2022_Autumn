while updating the information of the cars:
    set 4 spots for each WiFi lamp (each spot can link at most one car)
    for k in cars:
        for i in WiFi lamps:
            if the distance between WiFi lamp i and car k is no more than 100m:
                link an edge between car k and the 4 spots of WiFi lamp i #即：在二分图中连接车与WiFi灯柱的边
