Part 2

â€‹	In Part 2, our goal is to establish an overall optimal configuration of all lampposts within a certain area. Instead of simply simulating all measures, we took a more natural q-Learning approach under the thought of greedy algorithms. The machine-learning process, which relied merely on the mathematical index of a given distribution as shown in model 1, gradually narrowed the result till a fixed distribution as shown in **Diagram ?**. In order to confirm the accuracy of the algorithm, we randomly altered certain sets of lampposts and withdrew the consequent changes in variables. After that, we chose the uniformity of lamppost points as the independent variable and conducted a sensitivity analysis, which, after eliminating certain anomalous data, proved that the results were accurate enough. Out of considerations of dual confirmation, we also checked that the results turned out to be optimal.
