â€‹	In the simulation process, we consider each road block as an array of cars. In each round of the update process, we begin the operation of each road from the first car in its array till the last. Notice that in our dynamic updating process, each car, except from the first in the array, possesses a unique action dependent on its predecessor. In short, the car evaluates its capability of reaching the next intersection before the red light and performs correspondent deceleration or acceleration while controlling the safe distance between the two cars at the same time, the mathematical formulas of which are shown in the pseudocode below. As for the first car in the array, it similarly decides its action, and randomly decides to turn to the next road if it ultimately reaches the intersection with the green light on.
